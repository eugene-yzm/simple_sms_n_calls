# Welcome

This application enables easy, private communications via an open source server. Since email and SMS are not reliably
encrypted, easycomm sends a notification via these channels that you have an encrypted message on the easycomm server.

Easycomm is not full-featured.  It lacks some basic things, such as authentication.  Your pull requests are welcome,
but the goal of easycomm is primarily to contain clear, easy to understand code.

recipient fields for your message, you should be able to send a text message to your phone.

- To get the tests to pass, you'll want to use test credentials from Twilio.
